<h1>Implementation of VPN Tunnel</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
A private network constructed on top of a public network, typically the Internet, is called a virtual private network, or VPN. Even though their communication may pass through a public network, computers inside a VPN can connect securely, exactly like if they were on a true private network that is physically isolated from the outside world. With the use of a VPN, staff members may safely access their company's intranet while on the go. Businesses can also use VPNs to extend their private networks domestically and internationally.


This lab's goal is to assist students in comprehending how a VPN operates. We concentrate on a particular kind of VPN (the most popular one), which is constructed on top of the transport layer. We are going to construct a basic VPN from the ground up.
